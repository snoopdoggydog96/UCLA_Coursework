IMPORTANT NOTE: 
I am retaking this class, as I dropped it late (9th week) last quarter from overloading on classes.
I just haave a few classes remaining but I finished most of the labs for CS111 already.
I am resubmitting most of the same code (with some nominal changes if any) for most labs as I managed to get most of the programs to work as specified by the specs.
Unless the specs change (which as of now they have not), I will be submitting work that has been submitted before.
If their is an anti-cheating script my old submitted work may pop up and I hope that is not a significant issue.
I will attempt to recomment the code to be more concise and so that things do not match up quite exactly and so the TA's can see I actually understand the code I have written.

Comments:
I did not have much difficulty with this project.
My largest issue was figuring out exactly how the getlong_opt() function worked and the different options, and then figuring out how to implement causing the segfault and catch based on those inputted flags.
Besides that I am very familiar with creating files with the correct permissions, opening file descriptors, closing file descriptors, and dup2() (copying a file descriptor such as STDIN to another one for IPC or to capture the keyboard input and store it in a buffer).
Besides that my only other difficulty was understanding how signals work and  how to handle and catch signals.
Once I made the sighandler, things became much simpler.
Overall the project was not very difficult, probably because I have already worked many hours on it and simply needed to relook over my old work and rewrite any sloppy code and recomment things more concicsely.
