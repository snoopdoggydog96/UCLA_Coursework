   i. Terminal Attributes (termios, tcgetattr, tcsetattr)

	 http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html

   iii. Fork()/execvp() and Pipe()/dup2() and close()/kill() for creating a child for interprocess communication between parent and child processes via pipeline and then killing() child process and closing all open file descriptors assosciated with each process (SHUTDOWN PROCESSING).

NEW CITATIONS NEEDED FOR PROJECT 1B

   vi. Socket Programming
   	  http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/socket.7.htm
   vii. Zlib Usage
   	  https://www.zlib.net/manual.html
	  https://www.zlib.net/zlib_how.html
	  https://www.zlib.net/zpipe.c

b. Makefile
   make clean - returns directory to freshly untared state
   make dist - builds lab1b tarball from lab1b-server.c and lab1b-client.c 
   make - creates executable named lab1b-server and lab1b-client

c. Usage/Comments
   Server:
	a. --port #(required)
	   i. Initialize a socket() (TCP/AF_INET) and check the system has an available socket to bind a port # to, if not throw an error.   
	   ii. Bind() a port number required by the user, throw an error if the port # is in use. 	       a. saves the necessary server info in the struct sockaddr_in serv_addr
	      b. Initialize Child process to exec a Shell and pass sent Client Data to shell, and shell output from Server to shell. 
	   iii. Listen() for client requests to sockfd
	   iv. If a client makes a request, use the accept() function call save the necessary client info in the struct sockaddr_in cli_addr as well as relaying serv_addr to the client for communication over the specified Internet Protocol.
	   v. IPC OVER TCP/IP
	      a. This was exactly what we did in Project1a, with the difference being how IPC is conducted by using newsockfd as our STDIN file descriptor to read/write data between client and server over a specified Internet Protocol.

	b. --compress (not required)
	   vi. Compression before IPC over TCP/IP (by far the most difficult part of project)
	       a. The client must compress the data to send  using the infWrapper function which is heavily modeled after the inf() function referred to in the sources.
	       b. The server must decompress the sent data from the client using the defWrapper function which is heavily modeled after the inf() function referred to in the sources. 
	   
   	c. --log (not required)
	  vii.  NO COMPRESS FLAG:  Keep track of all bytes Sent by Client and Received from Server.
	  viii. COMPRESS FLAG: log contains random text that is seemingly garbage however the functionality remains the same (i.e. byte redution achieved w/o altering functionality of program)
