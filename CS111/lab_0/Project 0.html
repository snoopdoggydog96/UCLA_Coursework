<h1>Project 0<br>
Warm-Up</h1>
</center>

<h2>INTRODUCTION:</h2>
<p>
It is not uncommon for students come into this course without basic C software development 
skills (which should have been developed in the CS111 prerequisites),  and invest a great deal of time and frustrating effort in the first two projects 
before concluding they will not pass the course and must drop.  We have created this
simple warm-up to determine whether or not students are prepared to work on C programming 
projects.
Most students should find this project to be relatively easy (a few hours of work,
mostly understanding the APIs).
If you do not find this project to be relatively straight-forward, you may want to reconsider
whether or not you are ready to take this course.
</p>

<h2>RELATION TO READING AND LECTURES:</h2>
<p>
None.  
This project requires only C programming skills and basic familiarity with command line interfaces and makefiles that incoming students should already possess.  Mastery of the material covered in a class like 35L should be enough to make this project straightforward.
</p>

<h2>PROJECT OBJECTIVES:</h2>
<ul>
    <li> ensure students have a working Linux development environment.</li>
    <li> ensure students can code, compile, test and debug simple C programs.</li>
    <li> introduce and demonstrate the ability to use basic POSIX file operations.</li>
    <li> introduce and demonstrate the ability to process command line arguments.</li>
    <li> introduce and demonstrate the ability to catch and handle run-time exceptions.</li>
    <li> introduce and demonstrate the ability to return informative exit status.</li>
    <li> demonstrate the ability to research and exploit non-trivial APIs.</li>
    <li> demonstrate the ability to construct a standard <tt>Makefile</tt>.</li>
    <li> demonstrate the ability to write software that conforms to a Command
         Line Interface (CLI) specification.</li>
</ul>

<h2>DELIVERABLES:</h2>
A single compressed tarball (<tt>.tar.gz</tt>) containing:
<ul>
    <li> a single C source module that compiles cleanly (with <em>gcc</em>, with no errors or warnings).</li>
    <li> a <tt>Makefile</tt> to build the program and the tarball.</li>
    <li> two screen snapshot(s) from a <em>gdb(1)</em> session: 
	 <ul>
	 	<li> <tt>backtrace.png</tt> ...  showing a segfault and associated stack-trace</li>
		<li> <tt>breakpoint.png</tt> ...  showing a breakpoint and variable inspection</li>
    	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> a <tt>README</tt> file with identification information,
         a description of the included files,
    	 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing_(software)">smoke-test cases</a> in the <tt>check</tt> target,
         and any other information about your submission that you would like
	 to bring to our attention 
	 (e.g., research, limitations, features, testing methodology).</li>
</ul>

<h2>PROJECT DESCRIPTION:</h2>
<ol type="1">
    <li> (if you do not already have one)
    	bring up or obtain access to a Linux development environment.  
	Your development environment should include (at least):
	<ul>
		<li>gcc</li>
		<li>libc (e.g., glibc or libc6-dev)</li>
		<li>make</li>
		<li>gdb</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li> (if you are not already familiar with them) study the following manual sections:
	<ul>
	    <li>POSIX file operations ...
    		<em>open(2), creat(2), close(2), dup(2), read(2), write(2), exit(2), signal(2)</em>,
		and this brief tutorial on 
		<a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring18/cs111/projects/fd_juggling.html">file descriptor manipulation</a>.
	    </li>
	    <li><em>strerror(3)</em> ... function that interprets the error codes
	        returned from failed system calls.</li>
    	    <li><em>getopt(3)</em> ... the framework we will use for argument
		handling in all projects for this course.</li>
	    <li><em>tar(1)</em> (and the <strong>-z</strong> option) ... program for
	        archiving files in a tarball.</li>
	    <li><em>gdb(1)</em> (and the <tt>run</tt>, <tt>bt</tt>,
	        <tt>list</tt>, <tt>print</tt> and <tt>break</tt> 
		commands in particular) ... a Linux debugger for C/C++ programs.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	You will probably find understanding <em>getopt(3)</em> to be the most
	difficult part of this project.
    	Feel free to seek out other examples/tutorials for these functions, but make
	 sure you cite those sources in your <tt>README</tt>.
    	</p>
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li> write a program that copies its standard input to its standard output
    	 by <em>read(2)</em>-ing from file descriptor 0 (until encountering an
	 end of file) and <em>write(2)</em>-ing to file descriptor 1.
	 If no errors (other than EOF) are encountered, your program should
	 <em>exit(2)</em> with a return code of 0.
	 <p>
	 Your program executable should be called <tt>lab0</tt>,
	 and accept the following <u>(optional)</u> command line arguments (in any combination or order):
	 </p>
    	 <ul>
	     <li> <strong>--input=</strong><em>filename</em> ...
	     	  use the specified file as standard input (making it the new fd0).
		  <br>
		  If you are unable to open the specified input file,
		  report the failure (on <tt>stderr</tt>, file descriptor 2) 
		  using <em>fprintf(3)</em>,  and <em>exit(2)</em> with a return code of 2.
		  </li>
	     <li> <strong>--output=</strong><em>filename</em> ...
	     	  create the specified file and use it as standard output (making it the new fd1).
		  <br>
		  If you are unable to create the specified output file,
		  report the failure (on <tt>stderr</tt>, file descriptor 2) 
		  using <em>fprintf(3)</em>, and <em>exit(2)</em> with a return code of 3.
		  </li>
	     <li> <strong>--segfault</strong> ... force a segmentation fault (e.g., by 
	     	  calling a subroutine that sets a <tt>char *</tt> pointer to <tt>NULL</tt>
		  and then stores through the null pointer).  If this argument is specified,
		  do it immediately, and do not copy from stdin to stdout.
		  </li>
	     <li> <strong>--catch</strong> ... use <em>signal(2)</em> to
	     	  register a <tt>SIGSEGV</tt> handler
		  that catches the segmentation fault, logs an error message
		  (on <tt>stderr</tt>, file descriptor 2) and <em>exit(2)</em> with a 
		  return code of 4.
		  </li>
	 </ul>
	<p>
	When you print out an error message (e.g., because an open failed), your message
	should include enough information to enable a user to understand not merely the
	nature of the problem but its cause ... for example:
	</p><ul>
	   <li> which argument caused the problem ... e.g., <strong><tt>--input</tt></strong></li>
	   <li> which file could not be opened ... e.g., <tt>myfile.txt</tt></li>
	   <li> the reason it could not be opened ... e.g., no such file</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>
	<p>
	Do your argument parsing with <em>getopt_long(3)</em>.  This is, for
	historical reasons, a somewhat convoluted API, but ...
	</p><ul>
	   <li>	it is very similar APIs are used in many other languages and systems.</li>
	   <li> I want you to gain experience with the very common trial-and-error
	   	process of learning how to use a non-trivial API.</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>
	<p>
	If you encounter an unrecognized argument you should print out an error message
	including a correct usage line, and <em>exit(2)</em> with a return code
	of 1.</p></li>
	<p></p>
	<p>
	To ensure that operations are performed in the right order when multiple
	arguments are specified, it is suggested that you 
	</p><ul>
	   <li> first process all arguments and store the results in variables</li>
	   <li> then check which options were specified and carry actions out 
	        in the correct order:
		<ol type="1">
		   <li>do any file redirection</li>
		   <li>register the signal handler</li>
		   <li>cause the segfault</li>
		   <li>if no segfault was caused, copy stdin to stdout</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>
	<p>
	It is relatively easy to generate primitive error messages with
	<em>perror(3)</em>, but if you study the documentation you will
	see how to get access to the underlying error descriptions, which
	you could then use with <tt>fprintf(stderr,...</tt> to generate
	better formatted error messages to the correct file descriptor.
	</p>
    	<p>
	Note that to use the advanced debugging features of <em>gdb(1)</em> you will need
	to compile your program with the <strong>-g</strong> option, which adds debugging
	symbol table information to your program.
	</p>
    
    <p></p>
    <li> create a <tt>Makefile</tt> that supports the following targets:
	<ul>
	    <li>(default) ... build the <tt>lab0</tt> executable.
		To maximize comile-time error checking, you should compile 
		your program with the 
		<strong><tt>-Wall</tt></strong> and
		<strong><tt>-Wextra</tt></strong> options.
	        </li>
	    <li><tt>check</tt> ... runs a quick smoke-test on whether or
	    	not the program seems to work, supports the required
		arguments, and properly reports success or failure.
		<br>
		Please include a brief description (in your <tt>README</tt>)
		of what checks you chose to include in your smoke-test.
		</li>
	    <li><tt>clean</tt> ... delete <u>all</u> files created by the
	        Makefile, and return the directory to its freshly untared state.</li>
	    <li><tt>dist</tt> ... build the distribution tarball.</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li> run your program (with the <strong>--segfault</strong> argument) under
    	  <em>gdb(1)</em>
	  <ul>
	  	<li>take the fault</li>
		<li>get a stack backtrace</li>
		<li>take a screen snapshot (to be included with your submission)</li>
    	  </ul>
	  <p>
    	  Putting the code that causes the SEGFAULT in a separate subroutine
	  will make the stack trace a little more interesting.
    	  </p>
    </li>
    <li> run your program (with the <strong>--segfault</strong> argument) under
    	  <em>gdb(1)</em>
	  <ul>
	  	<li>set a break-point at the bad assignment</li>
		<li>run the program up to the breakpoint</li>
		<li>inspect the pointer to confirm that it is indeed NULL</li>
		<li>take a screen snapshot (to be included with your submission)</li>
    	  </ul>
	  <p>
    	  You will not be able to list lines of code, print data, or set breakpoints
	  in <em>gdb</em> unless your program has been compiled with the <strong>-g</strong>
	  (debug symbols) switch.
    	  </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
</p><h3>Summary of exit codes</h3>
<ul>
	<tt>0</tt> ... copy successful<br>
	<tt>1</tt> ... unrecognized argument<br>
	<tt>2</tt> ... unable to open input file<br>
	<tt>3</tt> ... unable to open output file<br>
	<tt>4</tt> ... caught and received <tt>SIGSEGV</tt><br>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h2>SUBMISSION:</h2>
<p>
Your <strong>README</strong> file (for this and every lab) must include lines of the form:
</p><ul>
	<strong>NAME:</strong> <em>your name</em><br>
	<strong>EMAIL:</strong> <em>your email</em><br>
	<strong>ID:</strong> <em>your student ID</em>
</ul>
And, if slip days are allowed on this project, and you want to use some,
this too must be included in the <strong>README</strong> file:
<ul>
	<strong>SLIPDAYS:</strong> <em>#days</em>
</ul>
If, for instance, you wanted to use two slip-days, you would add the following
line:
<ul>
	<strong>SLIPDAYS: 2</strong>
</ul>
Your name, student ID, and email address  should also appear as comments at the top
of your <tt>Makefile</tt> and each source file.
<p></p>
<p>
Your tarball should have a name of the form
<tt>lab0-</tt><em>yourStudentID</em><tt>.tar.gz</tt>.
You can sanity check your submission with this 
<a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring18/cs111/projects/P0_check.sh">test script</a>.
There will be no manual regrading on this project.
Submissions that do not pass the sanity check are likely to receive very low scores.
</p>
<p>
We will test it on a departmental Linux server.
You would be well advised to test all the functionality of your submission on 
that platform before submitting it.
</p>
